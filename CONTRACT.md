# Shared UI contract, version 1

Core, auth and admin may consume the same dependency-free package. This package
must never depend on any of them. Its main exports use standard Web/Intl APIs,
with no Node imports, browser DOM requirement, network calls or client framework.

- `createPresentation`: bounded immutable catalogues, custom default messages,
  account/query/Accept-Language/default negotiation, English fallback, Intl plurals
  and numbers, RTL direction, constrained local assets and theme variables.
- `renderDocument`: shared HTML document, skip link, main landmark, title, responsive
  CSS and explicit nonce-bearing script tags. Caller owns HTTP/security headers.
- `field`, `button`, `alert`, `navigation`, `table`, `pagination`, `emptyState`:
  escaped values and semantic HTML. Fields associate hints/errors with controls.
- `stylesheet`: shared CSS with logical properties, focus indicators and dark mode.
- `escapeHtml`: text/attribute escaping, not authorization or URL validation.

Only generic --ui-* theme variables live here. Legacy auth theme aliases are
adapted in urlcode-auth. Auth owns its catalogue IDs and composes them into the
shared factory; core can register its own defaults without importing auth. The auth
and admin workflows, notices, validation, secrets, CSP and CSRF never move here.

Tailwind CSS is compiled at build time and embedded by the shared document renderer.
The shadcn Button/Input/Card recipes are adapted to server HTML (see THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md).
Document layouts are generic default, compact and application variants. No claim
of full WCAG 2.2 AA conformance follows from semantic markup tests.

`renderDocument` optionally accepts `theme: { nonce }` for an appearance toggle.
The host owns the matching CSP nonce. Labels live in the generic `theme.*`
catalogue; remembered appearance is origin-local and independent of identity.

This is the agreed extraction from the working implementations. Version 1 adds,
beside it and without changing the exports above:

- `compileTemplate` and the kit template language: `{{path}}` always escaped,
  `#if`/`else`, `#each`, `{{> partial}}`, `{{t "key"}}`, `href`/`date`/`number`
  helpers, comments with a `viewModel: name@1` declaration. No expressions, no
  logic, no raw output; only renderer-produced `Markup` passes unescaped; bounded
  source, nesting, partial depth, iterations and output.
- `kitTemplates`: shipped partials in shadcn/ui markup with declared view models
  and sample views; `kitCss` and `kitAssets`: a static stylesheet on shadcn/ui
  variables with light and dark values, two nonce-bound enhancement scripts,
  content-hashed names.
- `resolveTheme`: a project theme block (name, logo, favicon, back link, HSL or
  hex colours for light and dark, radius, font) validated against a narrow
  grammar, separate from the `--ui-*` theme variables above.
- `createKit`: override order project file, then extension template, then kit;
  extensions add templates only under their own namespace; complete pages with
  nonce-bound style and scripts, a strict CSP and `no-store`; a report of
  overrides, templates behind their view model and translation coverage.
- `PresentationContext.has`, `formatDate`, `formatNumber` and
  `Presentation.english`, `defaultLocale`, `coverage`: additive.
- The `./host` entry (Node only): `createUiExtension`, the `ui` runtime
  extension owning `extensions.ui`, reading bounded project copy, template and
  stylesheet files, and serving the kit assets under `<mount>/static/`, declared
  as `immutableAssets` so the runtime caches them publicly; `loadProjectUi`;
  and the `urlcode-ui` CLI (`list`, `eject`, `preview`, `doctor`, `copy`).

The main entry stays dependency-free and free of Node imports. The `./host`
entry uses `node:fs` and `node:path` and mirrors the runtime's extension
contract structurally, so the package still depends on nothing. Project
templates are data in the kit language, never evaluated code; the CSS is
served as an asset by the extension, or embedded by `renderDocument` for
callers that do not use the kit. No claim of full WCAG 2.2 AA conformance
follows from the structural tests.

`icon(name)` renders a fixed package-owned decorative SVG from the `IconName`
allowlist. It accepts no markup, URL or styling input. Keep visible labels; icons
are hidden from assistive technology and cannot receive focus. `button` accepts
an optional third icon argument, and navigation items accept `icon`.

Version 1 also adds the form and deadline helpers auth and admin used to keep
as private copies:

- `hiddenField(name, value)`: an escaped `<input type="hidden">`; the name follows the `field` grammar.
- `postForm({action, csrf, fields, label, destructive?, icon?, className?})`: a `method="post"` form with the CSRF hidden field, trusted field markup and one submit `button`; `action` must pass `safeHref` unchanged, `destructive` adds `ui-button-destructive`.
- `withDeadline(fn, ms, message)`: races `fn(signal)` against a timer, aborts the signal and rejects with `Error(message)` at the deadline, and always clears the timer. Web APIs only.

The default kit layout is now `layout@2`: it accepts generic `layout`
(default/compact/application), `themeToggle` and nonce-bound `themeBootstrap`
markup. Existing project layout@1 overrides keep rendering and are reported as
behind by doctor. Theme choice follows the system until the icon toggle is used,
then remembers light/dark; no dropdown or visible appearance label is required.
